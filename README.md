### Use-case for this Wordpress theme:
We wanted to create a simple theme for small business owners who quickly want to set up a small web-shop and start selling products. The goal was not to create the next big thing or to reinvent the wheel, but rather to make a product for the normal folks out there that just want to get started.
Our theme is more than anything a "starter-package". It's purpose is to get you kick-started on your shop and quickly get you out there for people to see. It is designed to only contain the utter most crucial features, such as blog-posts/articles to advertise the products and product-cards.The
blog-posts/articles are crucial for us as we determined that it was an important part of what reinforces the buyer-seller relationship when surfing the site.
The product-cards are more or less self explanatory as they serve to let the user see a overview of all the products on the page, and makes it possible to actually purchase the products being sold the the website.
These are the key features of our theme, because in our vision, "less is more" - Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
